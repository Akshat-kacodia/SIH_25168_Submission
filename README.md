# About Our Project

**Overview -**

Our project addresses the urgent challenges in modern agriculture—soil degradation, unpredictable weather, and pest/disease outbreaks—by providing farmers with a smart, data-driven advisory system. The platform leverages AI, IoT, and hyperspectral imaging to deliver real-time, localized, and personalized recommendations, helping farmers improve crop productivity, conserve resources, and adopt sustainable practices.

**Key Features -**
- **Hyperspectral Imaging & AI**  
  - Uses **MATLAB Hyperspectral Imaging Library, Image Processing Toolbox, and Deep Learning Toolbox**.  
  - Extracts vegetation and soil indices (NDVI).  
  - Detects anomalies and predicts stress conditions using **CNNs and LSTMs**.  

- **IoT Sensor Integration**  
  - Collects real-time field data: soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and leaf wetness.  
  - Fuses sensor data with spectral analysis for **zone-specific alerts** and improved accuracy.  

- **Smart Advisory & Predictions**  
  - Recommends **optimal sowing times, irrigation schedules, fertilizer usage, and pest/disease management**.  

- **Farmer-Friendly Dashboard**  
  - Built with **Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts**.  
  - Displays **spectral health maps, soil summaries, temporal trends, and risk predictions**.  
  - Provides **multilingual support with voice/visual prompts**, making it accessible for farmers with limited digital literacy.
 
**Impact & Sustainability -**
- Shifts farming from **reactive to proactive management**.  
- Improves **yields and profitability** while reducing crop losses.  
- Promotes **water conservation, organic practices, and carbon footprint tracking**.  
- Scalable and adaptable to **different agro-climatic regions and crops**.
